# Isolumia-Simple
Simple Dead by Daylight Unlocker

# No longer updated
This version will no longer receive updates, since they reintroduced server sided ownership checks you aren't able to normally use characters u don't own anymore.
I'm not making the fix for this open source. To get updated versions including the <b>completely free</b> DLC fix (lets you use characters you don't own again) and a <b>free permanent Steam DLCs</b> method join the Discord server.
